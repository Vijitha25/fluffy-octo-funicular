Fractal based image encryption


OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT-

The below steps gives us a brief whereabouts of the project. Fractals are never ending complex patterns,which embed a smaller picture inside a bigger one and the cycle keeps repeating,for example - when you are standing between two
parallel mirrors and each mirror reflects an image which then reflects an image
causing infinite mirroring. Fractals are vaguely similar to this but may differ in
shapes and structure.
As the main component for encryption revolves around randomness my idea was to
incorporate fractals for encryption.I have decided to use the Mandelbrot set to
generate the values of the key, thereby bringing in some chaos to the system in
order for it to be secure.

The attached pdf gives a brief pseudocode of the above.
